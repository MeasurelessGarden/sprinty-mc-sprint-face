## ???
- can I store sprinty user prefs in discord user tags? so they can't be wiped out if sprinty goes down?

- ignore multiline messages - they cannot be commands

- change to babel-preset-even, babel-preset-es2015 is depricated.

## features
- word count diffs
- @Sprinty run @here
- nevermind / oops commands
- NN until NN
- or sprint at 25 for 30?
- ok ((join))
- wait no ((cancel))
